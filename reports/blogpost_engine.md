# Deep Learning: Applying Google's Latest Search algorithm on biggest Danish job site


## Abstract
Search engine results is a common cause, especially for non-English languages. In this project, different models - including Google Search's underlying technique (called BERT) - are applied to improve the search engine of Denmark's biggest job portal: jobindex.dk. The goal is to determine whether modern Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing techniques can improve danish-language searches. After comparing direct results with TFIDF and BERT, it's possible to conclude that BERT excels for zero-results search queries and on longer search queries. It also provides noteworthy performance results, in terms of time to return a search. 

## Disclaimer

## Intro
Non-english languages pose a challenge in terms of Machine Learning challenges, since there's not as much data to train models when compared to the english language. However, recent breakthroughs allows having good model results
